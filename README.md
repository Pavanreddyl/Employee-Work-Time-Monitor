3. **Apache Tomcat**:
   - Tomcat serves as the web server and servlet container for deploying the application.
   - It handles HTTP requests and responses, ensuring smooth interaction between the client and server.

4. **Data Access Objects (DAO)**:
   - DAOs are used to abstract and encapsulate all access to the data source.
   - They provide a clean interface for accessing the database and managing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

#### Architecture
1. **Presentation Layer**:
   - JSP/Servlets for the front-end interface.
   - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive and interactive UI.

2. **Business Logic Layer**:
   - Java Beans and Services to handle business logic.
   - DAO pattern to interact with the database.

3. **Data Access Layer**:
   - DAOs to perform database operations.
   - MySQL for data storage and retrieval.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Development Environment**:
   - Install Eclipse IDE.
   - Setup MySQL database.
   - Configure Apache Tomcat server in Eclipse.

2. **Database Design**:
   - Design database schema for employees, time logs, tasks, and reports.
   - Implement tables and relationships in MySQL.

3. **Developing DAOs**:
   - Create DAOs for each entity (Employee, TimeLog, Task, Report).
   - Implement CRUD operations using JDBC.

4. **Business Logic Implementation**:
   - Develop services for time tracking, task management, and reporting.
   - Ensure data validation and business rule enforcement.

5. **User Interface Development**:
   - Design and implement JSP pages for the user interface.
   - Integrate front-end with back-end services using Servlets.

6. **Testing and Deployment**:
